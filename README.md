# Word Ladder – Search Algorithms

This repository implements several classic AI search algorithms to find a valid transformation path between two words, using add/remove/replace character operations and a dictionary of valid words.

Supported algorithms: A* Search, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Local Beam Search, and a Genetic Algorithm.

## Usage
Run the script and provide a start word, goal word, and search method:

```bash
python advanced_search_algorithms.py
